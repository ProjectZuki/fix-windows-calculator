# Windows Calculator Alignment Fix

Addressing an issue with the Windows calculator where [some of the buttons are off by a single pixel](https://youtube.com/shorts/IHhpu_bfYZk?si=wgmeiUmS5S3lxKSa) between the buttons:</br>
$x^2$ $\sqrt[2]{x}$ </br>
`8` `9` </br>
This is an attempt to resolve the issue by building a calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
